# Introduction to R ----
## Data Types ----

# R is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable before assigning a value to it. R automatically determines the data type based on the value you assign.

### Numeric ----
# • Integer: Whole numbers (1, 2, -3)
# • Double: Floating-point numbers (3.14, -0.25)

### Characters ----
# • String of text ("Hello", "Mabuhay Philippines")

### Logical ----
# • Boolean values (TRUE, FALSE)

# For restarting environment
rm(list = ls())

# Assign my_number to be 10
my_number <- 10

# Assign my_character to be "Hello World"
my_character <- "Hello World"

# Assign my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE
