# Vector ----
## Data Structure c() function ----

# Vectors are one of the most fundamental data structures in R. They are essentially ordered collections of elements, where all elements must be of the same data type.

# For restarting environment
rm(list = ls())

# Declared variable of different types using vector
my_number <- c(1, 10, 15)
my_character <- c("z", "x", "y")
my_logical <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

# Check class of my_number
class(my_number)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
