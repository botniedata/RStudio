## Comment ----

# '#' symbol is used to start a comment. Any text following # on the same line will be ignored by the R interpreter. This is a convenient way to add explanations or notes to your code without affecting its execution.

# Formatting and organizing code within the script and document
# By using multiple levels of headings (#, ##, ###, ####), you can create a hierarchical structure that visually outlines different sections of your code. This can make it easier to navigate and understand, especially for larger or more complex projects.
